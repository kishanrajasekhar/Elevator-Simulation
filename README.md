# Elevator-Simulation

This is a simulation of elevators operating within a building. There are five elevators picking up passengers from five different floors. 
Passengers spawn at different floors at period times and request a destination floor. An elevator will pick up a passenger if it is heading
in the direction of the passengers' requested floor. Since the elevators work concurrently, different elevators will pick up passengers 
from different floors at the same time. An elevator cannot pick up passengers from a floor if another elevator is going to that floor to 
pick them up.
